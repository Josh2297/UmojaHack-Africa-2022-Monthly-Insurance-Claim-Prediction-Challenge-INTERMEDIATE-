# UmojaHack-Africa-2022-Monthly-Insurance-Claim-Prediction-Challenge-INTERMEDIATE-
Team Cryptic: 8th place out of 453 . Short-term insurance claims are one of the largest costs in the insurance industry, and are extremely difficult to forecast. Zimnat Insurance wants to predict the value of future claims per client, in order to better forecast annual costs.  The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to predict how much a client will claim from Zimnat per month for a whole year.  The solution will aid Zimnat in being better prepared to address claims that are submitted, and improve customer satisfaction by alerting clients to possible claims they will make in the future.
